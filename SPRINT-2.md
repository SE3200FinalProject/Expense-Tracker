New Feature Implemented: Budgeting Module

For Milestone 3, our team worked on adding the Budgeting Module feature. This feature lets users set a monthly budget by entering the month, year, and amount. The system then calculates how much was spent and how much is left.This helps users better manage their spending and understand their expenses more clearly.

The backend for this feature was fully completed and tested. The frontend part is still being finished.

Main backend endpoints used:

POST /api/budgets

GET /api/budgets?month=&year=

GET /api/budgets/summary?month=&year=
Stand-Up Meeting Minutes


Week 13

We were still fixing the frontend and backend connection from Milestone 2.

The frontend had issues committing and connecting properly.

We planned a meeting with the professor to help fix the connection.

Abdu fixed the connection and pushed the working backend and frontend to the team repository.

Week 14

We discussed Milestone 3 requirements.

We decided to implement the Budgeting Module as our new feature.

Abdu worked on the backend and created all required API endpoints.

Droi started preparing the frontend budget UI.

Week 15

One team member had a serious medical emergency (heart attack).

The professor gave us a short extension.

Backend for the Budgeting Module is finished.

Frontend and deployment are still in progress.

Deployment Status

Because of an unexpected medical emergency in our team, deployment to Railway is still in progress. We are using the short extension given by the professor to finish the frontend and deploy the project as soon as possible.

The deployment link will be added once the app is live.
