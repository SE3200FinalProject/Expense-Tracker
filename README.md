# Expense Tracker – SE 3200 Final Project

This project is our final team project for SE 3200 (Software Design & Architecture).  
It is based on the provided React Expense Tracker and was converted into a full-stack application with a backend and database.

## Current Project Status (Milestone 3)

- Backend is complete and working.
- User authentication and expenses work locally.
- A new feature was added:Budgeting Module (backend).
- Frontend UI for the Budgeting Module is still being worked on.
- Deployment to Railway is in progress due to a medical emergency in our team.
- The professor granted our team a short extension.

## New Feature: Budgeting Module

Users can now:
- Set a monthly budget (month, year, amount)
- View total spending for that month
- See the remaining balance

Backend API endpoints:
- POST /api/budgets
- GET /api/budgets?month=&year=
- GET /api/budgets/summary?month=&year=

## How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

Deployment to Railway is currently not finished** due to
- Frontend still being worked on
